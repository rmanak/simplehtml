## Differences with Markdown
I have changed the markdown script so that underscore ``_`` does not
emphasize the text as it does originally in the Markdown syntax.
The reason is that markdown syntaxing applies to html files before latexing
that is a JavaScript, and underscore is used extensively in latex syntax.
