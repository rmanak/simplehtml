#About This Web Template:

## Features

This template 
is a [modified] collection of available tools on the web for creating readable
HTML pages, and enables the users to edit the content using a
text editor. It is perhaps
most useful for creating course pages, scientific web pages and
documentation. It has the following features:

- Allows writing \\( \LaTeX \\) in web using Mathjax%%refmath%%.
- Provides easy and quick formatting for HTML using Markdown%%refmk%%.
- Highlights source codes in various languages using code2html%%c2h%%.
- Creates table of contents for the document using
  PyHat%%refph%%.
- Generates references at the bottom of the page automatically.
- Provides an easy way to insert images with caption.
- Designed for simplicity, readability and portability (fonts included,
  web safe fonts, css verified, should work on any Unix-like machine)
- The content is pure ASCII text files and user interface is via
command line, good old fashion scientists' style!
- See other styles of this template: [[2]](../theme2) , [[3]](../theme3)

## Writing \\( \LaTeX \\) in HTML

This template is using Mathjax's online JavaScript
[[+[>]]](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) to convert
LaTeX equations to images.

Here is an example  of a formula written in HTML environment:
``\\( \pi = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{i}}{2i+1}  \;\;\; \& \;\;\; G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu} \\)``, which
generates: \\( \pi = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{i}}{2i+1} \;\;\; \& \;\;\; G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu} \\).
All you need to do is simply
put the equations (in LaTeX syntax) between &#92;&#92;&#40; &#92;&#92;&#41;  tags, for
inserting the formula inside the text.

Here is another example of creating centered latex equations:

<pre>
&lt;div&gt;
$$
g_{\mu \nu} =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
- \alpha^{2} & \beta &  0  & 0 \\
\beta & a^{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & r^{2}  & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & r^{2} \sin^{2} \theta
\end{array} \right) \;\;\;
\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}} dx = \pi \;\;\;\;
1 < 2 \;\;\; 3 &gt; 2
$$
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

which will be transformed to:

<div>
$$
g_{\mu \nu} =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
- \alpha^{2} & \beta &  0  & 0 \\
\beta & a^{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & r^{2}  & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & r^{2} \sin^{2} \theta
\end{array} \right) \;\;\;\;
\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}} dx = \pi \;\;\;\;
1 < 2 \;\;\; 3 > 2
$$
</div>

In the previous example ``<div></div>`` tags are necessary to protect the Markdown from
changing the equation inside.

## Markdown HTML Formatting

This template is using
Markdown[[+]](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a Perl script) to
convert the text files into formatted HTML files. 
The syntax of Markdown is described in details
[on the software's webpage[>]](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
You can try Markdown formatting with live preview
[here](https://stackedit.io/)[>].
It can also be
simply understood from the following examples of the *source codes* 
throughout this document.

### First Markdown Example

### Differences with Markdown
I have changed the markdown script so that underscore ``_`` does not
emphasize the text as it does originally in the Markdown syntax.
The reason is that markdown syntaxing applies to html files before latexing
that is a JavaScript, and underscore is used extensively in latex syntax.

## Images with Caption

### Right Floating Image
You can insert a right floating image with the syntax:

<pre>
&#123;&#123;This is the caption of the image. 
A plot of a function in Python!}}((img/surface.png))
</pre>

{{This is the caption of the image.
A plot of a function in Python!}}((img/surface.png))

An example is the image you are seeing on the right.


Paragraphs in Markdown are separated with an
empty line, similar to \\( \LaTeX \\).
For instance, each
word
of
this
sentence
are
in
separate
lines
in
the
[source
file](Template.txt),
but they all appear on the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph to fill up some space. So I will keep typing
until I created a long paragraph. So far I don't think it is long enough.
Let me find something from Wikipedia and copy paste it here.
A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written
beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a
particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an
expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no spaces between
words or other ones, and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating
directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized,
and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.
The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos,
similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[3] The Greek
paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow), which in English manuscripts in the
Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf
 has also been used in the same way.
There should be an image on the right side of this text.
An empty line separates the paragraphs.

### Center Floating Image

Another way to insert images with center floating is to
use syntac:

<pre>&#123;&#123;Images with center floating are
a bit larger allowing for more content in the
caption.}}[[img/HTML.jpg]]</pre>

which produces:

{{Images with center floating are
a bit larger allowing for more content in the
caption.}}[[img/HTML.jpg]]

Images (centered or right floating) can be inserted without caption as well,
by simply leaving the caption part completely empty:

<pre>&#123;&#123;}}[[img/HTML.jpg]]</pre>

{{}}[[img/HTML.jpg]]


### Right Floating Object

<R><span style="font-size:50px;"> \\( G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} \\)  </span></R>

You can also insert any html content in a right floating box by
putting it between ``<R></R>``. 
For instance the
image of the equation you are seeing on the right hand side is
in part an html code and in part a latex syntax that is being
converted using MathJax script. The code
that generates it is this:

``<R><span style="font-size:50px;">\\(G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi T_{\mu\nu}\\)</span></R>``

Also you can insert any valid HTML content
in the plain text file. See Makrdown's page %% refmk %% to learn more about how
it handles the HTML contents.

## Generating Table of Content

This template is using [PyHat](http://www.ferg.org/pyhat/) (a Python script) to
generate table of content(TOC). The TOC will occur at the location
specified by: &#91;TOC&#93;. For example the table of content of this
page is created using this method. See the [source](Template.txt) file
of the page to find the TOC tag. The following
headlines will all appear in the TOC at the top:

    ### Subsection
    to insert a section use level-2 headline: ``##``

    to insert a subsection use level-3 headline: ``###``

    #### subsub section
    to insert a subsubsection, use level-4 headline: ``####``

    these two subsection and subsubsection will appear in the TOC of this page.



### Subsection
to insert a section use level-2 headline: ``##``

to insert a subsection use level-3 headline: ``###``

#### subsub section
to insert a subsubsection, use level-4 headline: ``####``

these two subsection and subsubsection will appear in the TOC of this page.

***

## Creating References

To create a reference you can put your reference label between two
&#37;&#37;``myreflabel``&#37;&#37; and add a description to it
using the syntax:

    {myreflabel: reference description}

For example this  %% myref1 %% is going to appear in the references and this
%%my ref5%% as well. This %% my ref5  %% is the same reference.
{myref1: This is an example of references.}
{ my ref5:  Another reference.}
The reference description can appear anywhere in the text.
Below is the source file of the example above:

<pre>
For example this  &#37;&#37; myref1 &#37;&#37; is going to appear in the references and this
&#37;&#37;my ref5&#37;% as well. This &#37;&#37; my ref5  &#37;&#37; is the same reference.
&#123;myref1: This is an example of references.}
&#123; my ref5:  Another reference.}
The reference description can appear anywhere in the text.
Below is the source file of the example above:
</pre>

## Code Highlighting

This template is using [code2html[>]](https://www.palfrader.org/code/code2html/)
to highlight source
codes that are being inserted in the plain text file.

All you need to do is simply put the source code between &lt;C&gt; &lt;/C&gt;
tags (for C code). See below for the list of supported languages.

Following source code shows how you can highlight Perl, C++ and Python code:

### Perl
<pre>
&lt;PERL&gt;
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use IO::Handle;
 
 #Perl comment

 my ( $remaining, $total );
 
 $remaining = $total = shift(@ARGV);
 
 STDOUT->autoflush(1);
 
 while ( $remaining ) {
  printf ( "Remaining %s/%s \r", $remaining--, $total );
  sleep 1;
 }
 
 print "\n";
&lt/PERL&gt;
</pre>

Which will be highlighted as:

<PERL>
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use IO::Handle;
 
 #Perl comment

 my ( $remaining, $total );
 
 $remaining = $total = shift(@ARGV);
 
 STDOUT->autoflush(1);
 
 while ( $remaining ) {
  printf ( "Remaining %s/%s \r", $remaining--, $total );
  sleep 1;
 }
 
 print "\n";
</PERL>

### C++

<pre>
&lt;CPP&gt;
#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;vector&gt;
 
int main()
/* Multiple
   line comment
 */
try {
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec{3,4,3,1};
    int i{vec.at(4)};
}
//An exception handler, catches std::out_of_range
catch(std::out_of_range& e) {
    std::cerr&lt;&lt;"Accessing a non-existent element:"&lt;&lte.what()&lt;&lt;'\n';
}
catch(std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr&lt;&lt;"Exception thrown: "&lt;&lt;e.what()&lt;&lt;'\n';
}
&lt;/CPP&gt;
</pre>

And the highlighted version is:

<CPP>
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
 
int main()
/* Multiple
   line comment
 */
try {
    std::vector<int> vec{3,4,3,1};
    int i{vec.at(4)};
}
//An exception handler, catches std::out_of_range
catch(std::out_of_range& e) {
    std::cerr<<"Accessing a non-existent element: "<<e.what()<<'\n';
}
catch(std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr<<"Exception thrown: "<<e.what()<<'\n';
}
</CPP>


### PYTHON
<pre>
&lt;PYTHON&gt;
from pylab import *

t = arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = sin(2*pi*t)
plot(t, s)

xlabel('time (s)')
ylabel('voltage (mV)')
title('About as simple as it gets, folks')
grid(True)
savefig("test.png")
show()
&lt;/PYTHON&gt;
</pre>

which is highlighted here:

<PYTHON>
from pylab import *

t = arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = sin(2*pi*t)
plot(t, s)

xlabel('time (s)')
ylabel('voltage (mV)')
title('About as simple as it gets, folks')
grid(True)
savefig("test.png")
show()
</PYTHON>
