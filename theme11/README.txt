# ReadMe:
* To create a new page, create a file named for example ``myfile.txt`` 
(you can format it using [markdown syntax](format.html)) then add the file name
``myfile.txt``
to the list variable ``SOURCES`` at the top of ``Makefile``, 
then execute ``make`` command.

* You can learn Markdown formatting with live preview [[here[>]]](https://stackedit.io/).

* To edit the sidebar link panel, edit the file ``sidebar``. The syntax is 
the same as Markdown syntax.

* To edit the header, edit the file named: ``template``.

* To edit the footer links edit the file named: ``footbar``.

* For a page to have table of content add: &#91;TOC&#93; to the top 
of your source file (the ``myfile.txt`` text file). TOC will be created for
``<h2>`` (``##`` in Markdown syntax) and higher
headline tags in the source file. For example see [[this]](toc.html) as
the an html output generated by [[this source code]](toc.txt).

* Feel free to email me: <arman@phas.ubc.ca> about this template.

The source code of this page is [here](README.txt).
