Simple HTML
===========

This is a quick webpage generator and content management system 
powered by perl that combines all the good stuff from:
* Markdown
* code2html (for code highlighting)
* PyHat (for table of content generator)
* References (similar to wikipedia) 
* and some additional quick features, such as including 
(right or centered float) images with caption, including
other html files
