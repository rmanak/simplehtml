# Download and Getting Started
You can download the template and all the required scripts, fonts, CSS sheet, etc. from
[[here]](../theme1.tar.gz)[dl].

Extract the tarball to your public_html directory on the web server, execute
``make``, and you should see a website similar to this page. You can start with
editing the ``README.txt`` file and re-executing the ``make`` command.
